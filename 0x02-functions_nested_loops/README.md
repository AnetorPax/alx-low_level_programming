This Directory contains files that test our knowledge of nested looks and functions in C programming language. 
We are expected to creat a user defined function named "_putchar" _and use the fuction to print in diferrent source files with the aid of a header file named main. The function of each source code are alighted below.

File 0-putchar.c: 
It is a program that prints _putchar, _followed by a new line.

File 1-alphabet.c:
It is a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Using the prototype void print_alphabet(void);

FILE 2-print_alphabet_x10.c:
It holds a functiion that prints 10times the alphabet un lower case followed by a new line. using the prototype void print_alphabet_x10(void);.

FILE 3-islower.c:
It is a program that checks for lower case characters. usint the prototype int _islower(int c); _and return 1 if c is lowercase or 0 otherwise.

FILE 4-isalpha.c:
The program checks for alhpabetic character. using the prototype int _isalpha(int c);, _and returns 1 if c is a letter otherwise return 0.

FILE 5-sign.c:
The function prints the sign of a number using the prototype int print_sign(int n);. It returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero, Returns 0 and prints 0 id n is zero otherwise return -1 and print - if n is less than 0.

FILE 6-abs.c:
The function computes the absolute value of an integer. using the prototype int _abs(int);._

FILE 7-print_last_digit.c:
This function prints last digit of a number using the prototype int print_last_digit(int);.

File 8-24_hours.c:
this function prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59. Using the Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);.

FILE 9-times_table.c:
The function prints the 9 times table, starting with 0. Using the Prototype: void times_table(void);

FILE 10-add.c:
The function  adds two integers and returns the result using the Prototype: int add(int, int);

FILE 11-print_to_98.c;
It is  a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line. using the Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);.

FILE 100-times_table.c:
It is a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0. Using the Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);.

FILE 101-natural.c:
This is a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

FILE 102-fibonacci.c:
It is a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line. The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space , You are allowed to use the standard library.

FILE 103-fibonacci.c:
write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of a fibonacci, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library.

FILE 104-fibonacci.c:
The program finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
